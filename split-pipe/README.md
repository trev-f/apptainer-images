# Split-Pipe

This directory is all about building a container for the ParseBiosciences Pipeline.
As per the license, this container should only be stored locally in a single place.

A Parse Biosciences account is required for accessing the [download link](https://support.parsebiosciences.com/hc/en-us/articles/17200056667924-Pipeline-Download-Current-Version) and [documentation](https://support.parsebiosciences.com/hc/en-us/articles/23060102930580-Pipeline-Installation-Current-Version) for this software.

Download the latest pipeline version available today (20240725) -- v1.3.1.
I couldn't download from the command line with `wget` or `curl`, so had to download using the link on the website.
